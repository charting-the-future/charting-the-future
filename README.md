# Charting the Future: Harnessing LLMs for Quantitative Finance

Welcome to the companion repository for the book  
**Charting the Future: Harnessing LLMs for Quantitative Finance** (Colin Alexander, CFA, CIPM).

This repository provides:
- **Book Manuscript** (chapters, figures, references, teaching material)  
- **Working Code Examples** (sector-committee, portfolio management, labs)  
- **Research Summaries** (structured notes on key LLM + finance papers)  
- **Instructor Pack** (slides, labs, solutions for classroom adoption)  

The goal is to bridge **theory → practice**: every concept in the book is tied to reproducible code, data pipelines, and academic research.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/charting-the-future/charting-the-future.git
cd charting-the-future
```

### 2. Set up environment with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

We use `uv` for fast Python environment and dependency management. `uv` is a Rust-based, ultra-fast Python package and project manager. Refer to uv's [installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) guide.
Note: Mac users with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can simply run `brew install uv`.

The project targets Python 3.13.

From the project root directory, run:
```bash
# Sync dependencies (from pyproject.toml)
uv sync
```

This will create a `.venv` folder and install all dependencies in an isolated environment. 
Note: you don’t need to activate the environment manually — always run commands with `uv run ...`, e.g. `uv run my_module.py`.  It is an alias for `uv run python ...`.

### 3. Install the `sector-committee/` package
```bash
cd sector-committee
uv pip install -e .
```

### 4. Lint and test the code
```bash
uv run ruff check .    # run linter on current directory
uv run ruff format .   # format code
uv run pytest  # run test suite
```

### 5. Run the capstone notebook
```bash
uv run jupyter notebook notebooks/00_quickstart.ipynb
```

This walks through:  
agents → sector scores (1–5) → committee aggregation → long/short portfolio → beta-hedge.

## Research Summaries

The `research/` folder contains structured 1–2 page summaries of key LLM + finance papers.  
- Use `template_summary.md` for new submissions.  
- Each file is named `<year>_<shorttitle>_summary.md`.  
- All sources are indexed in `sources.md` with DOI/arXiv/SSRN links.
