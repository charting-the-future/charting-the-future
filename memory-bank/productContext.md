# Product Context: Why Multi-Agent Sector Analysis Matters

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional sector allocation relies heavily on discretionary analysis by human portfolio managers, leading to:

- **Inconsistent Decision Making**: Different analysts reach different conclusions using the same data
- **Cognitive Bias**: Human judgment affected by recency bias, anchoring, and confirmation bias
- **Limited Processing Capacity**: Inability to systematically process vast amounts of unstructured market data
- **Audit Trail Gaps**: Difficulty reconstructing the exact reasoning behind investment decisions
- **Timing Inefficiencies**: Slow response to rapidly changing market conditions and policy shifts

## Our Solution: Structured Multi-Agent Analysis

### Tri-Pillar Methodology

We decompose sector analysis into three orthogonal dimensions:

**1. Fundamentals (Default Weight: 50%)**
- Earnings and revenue revision trends
- Valuation metrics vs. historical ranges and peer sectors
- Input cost pressures and commodity sensitivity
- Policy and regulatory impact assessment
- Balance sheet strength and capital allocation patterns

**2. Sentiment (Default Weight: 25%)**
- Earnings call tone and management guidance changes
- Analyst estimate revision breadth and magnitude
- ETF and mutual fund flow patterns
- Options positioning and implied volatility skew
- News sentiment and narrative momentum

**3. Technicals (Default Weight: 25%)**
- Price trends relative to moving averages (50/200-DMA)
- Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) and breadth metrics
- Relative strength vs. SPY and other sectors
- Support/resistance levels and volume patterns
- Cross-asset correlation shifts

### Multi-Model Ensemble Approach

Rather than relying on a single model's interpretation, we employ:

- **OpenAI o4-mini-deep-research**: Fast, cost-effective analysis with web search integration
- **OpenAI o3-deep-research**: Deeper reasoning with enhanced research capabilities
- **Future Integration**: Claude, Gemini, and Grok for diversified analytical perspectives

Each model independently analyzes the same sector using structured prompts, then we aggregate their scores and confidence levels to reduce model-specific biases.

## How This Creates Value

### For Portfolio Managers
- **Systematic Process**: Consistent, repeatable methodology across all sectors
- **Enhanced Coverage**: Ability to monitor all 11 sectors simultaneously with equal rigor
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Every recommendation backed by cited, downloadable references
- **Confidence Calibration**: Quantified uncertainty helps with position sizing

### For Risk Management
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full reconstruction of decision logic from raw inputs to final scores
- **Bias Detection**: Multi-model disagreement flags potential analytical blind spots
- **Systematic Hedging**: Automatic beta neutralization prevents unintended market exposure
- **Turnover Control**: Built-in bands and cost budgets prevent excessive trading

### For Compliance and Governance
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Meets SR 11-7 model governance requirements
- **Documented Methodology**: Transparent scoring rubric and weight justification
- **Version Control**: Time-stamped prompts, context hashes, and model outputs
- **Performance Attribution**: Clear tracking of which models/factors drive P&L

## User Experience Goals

### For the Investment Team
1. **Weekly Sector Views**: Receive updated 1-5 scores with confidence intervals every Monday
2. **Drill-Down Capability**: Access supporting rationale and references for any sector score
3. **Regime Awareness**: Understand how macro conditions affect model confidence
4. **Exception Handling**: Immediate alerts when models strongly disagree or confidence drops

### For Operations
1. **Automated Order Generation**: Seamless translation from scores to sized, hedged orders
2. **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of inference costs vs. performance contribution
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures or data quality issues
4. **Capacity Management**: Position sizing that respects liquidity constraints

## Success Metrics

### Information Quality
- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of sector calls that prove correct over 4-week horizon
- **Information Coefficient**: Correlation between scores and subsequent sector performance
- **Calibration**: Alignment between stated confidence and actual prediction accuracy

### Operational Excellence
- **Latency**: Time from new information to updated sector scores
- **Uptime**: System availability during market hours
- **Cost Efficiency**: Inference cost per basis point of alpha generated

### Risk Management
- **Beta Stability**: Consistency of market-neutral positioning
- **Drawdown Control**: Maximum portfolio decline during adverse periods
- **Factor Exposure**: Unintended tilts toward style factors or macro themes

This multi-agent approach transforms sector analysis from an art into a systematic, auditable science while preserving the nuanced reasoning that human portfolio managers value. The result is more consistent, evidence-based investment decisions that can be scaled across the entire investment universe.
