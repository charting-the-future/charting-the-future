# Memory Bank for Charting the Future

This directory contains the **Memory Bank** for the "Charting the Future: Harnessing LLMs for Quantitative Finance" project. The Memory Bank enables coding agents to maintain persistent context and understanding across development sessions, transforming it from a stateless assistant into a knowledgeable development partner.

## What is the Memory Bank?

The Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that allows the coding agent to "remember" project details, architectural decisions, and implementation progress between conversations. When you start a new session, simply ask the agent to "follow your custom instructions in the memory-bank" and it should read these files to rebuild its complete understanding of the project.

## Benefits

### ðŸ§  **Persistent Context**
- Maintains deep understanding of the multi-agent sector committee architecture
- Preserves knowledge of technical decisions and implementation patterns
- Eliminates need to re-explain project goals and constraints

### ðŸ“ˆ **Consistent Development**
- Ensures predictable interactions aligned with project methodology
- Maintains coding standards and architectural patterns across sessions
- Preserves domain expertise in quantitative finance and LLM agents

### ðŸ“š **Self-Documenting Project**
- Creates valuable project documentation as a natural byproduct
- Provides clear onboarding materials for new team members
- Maintains audit trail of decisions and rationale

### ðŸ”„ **Scalable Knowledge Management**
- Works with projects of any complexity level
- Adapts to evolving requirements and scope changes
- Integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows

## File Structure

This Memory Bank contains the core files plus detailed project specifications organized in a spec-driven development structure:

```
memory-bank/
â”œâ”€â”€ projectbrief.md           # Foundation: mission, objectives, scope
â”œâ”€â”€ productContext.md         # Why: problem solving and value creation
â”œâ”€â”€ activeContext.md          # Current: spec-driven two-phase development plan
â”œâ”€â”€ systemPatterns.md         # How: architecture, patterns, implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ techContext.md            # With: technologies, tools, integrations
â”œâ”€â”€ progress.md               # Status: completed work and implementation roadmap
â”œâ”€â”€ phase1-chapter6-spec.md   # Phase 1: Deep Research Scoring System specification
â””â”€â”€ phase2-chapter7-spec.md   # Phase 2: Portfolio Construction Pipeline specification
```

### Core Files Explained

- **projectbrief.md** - The foundation document defining the multi-agent sector committee system for systematic investment decision-making
- **productContext.md** - Explains the tri-pillar methodology and how it creates value for portfolio managers and risk teams
- **activeContext.md** - Spec-driven two-phase development plan with clear chapter boundaries and implementation structure
- **systemPatterns.md** - Architectural patterns including factory design, ETF mappings, and risk frameworks
- **techContext.md** - Technical implementation details covering Python 3.13, OpenAI API, and compliance requirements
- **progress.md** - Updated status tracking with spec-driven implementation roadmap and success gates

### Project Specifications (Spec-Driven Development)

- **phase1-chapter6-spec.md** - Complete specification for Chapter 6 Deep Research Scoring System with measurable acceptance criteria
- **phase2-chapter7-spec.md** - Complete specification for Chapter 7 Portfolio Construction Pipeline with quantitative success metrics

## How to Use

### Starting a New Session
```
Ask coding agent to "follow your custom instructions in the memory-bank" at the beginning of any conversation
```

### Updating the Memory Bank
```
Ask coding agent to "update memory bank" after significant progress or changes
```

### Key Commands
- **"follow your custom instructions"** - Loads Memory Bank context
- **"update memory bank"** - Triggers comprehensive documentation review
- **"initialize memory bank"** - Creates initial Memory Bank structure (already done)

## Spec-Driven Development Methodology

This Memory Bank implements a rigorous spec-driven development approach that ensures measurable deliverables and prevents scope creep:

### Two-Phase Structure
- **Phase 1 (Chapter 6)**: Deep Research Scoring System - Multi-agent analysis producing 1-5 sector scores
- **Phase 2 (Chapter 7)**: Portfolio Construction Pipeline - Converting scores to beta-neutral ETF allocations

### Success Criteria Framework
- **100% Measurable Acceptance Criteria**: Every deliverable has quantitative, testable requirements
- **Numerical Success Metrics**: KPIs with specific targets (e.g., <5 min latency, 95%+ reliability, |beta| < 0.1)
- **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Technical and operational risks identified with mitigation plans
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Phase 2 cannot begin until Phase 1 meets all acceptance criteria

## Integration with Quantitative Finance Workflow

This Memory Bank is specifically designed for the sophisticated multi-agent financial analysis system described in the book. It captures:

- **Agent Architecture**: Factory patterns for OpenAI o4-mini and o3-deep-research models with strict JSON schema enforcement
- **ETF Universe**: 11 SPDR sectors with inverse ETF mappings and leverage adjustments for beta neutralization
- **Risk Management**: Beta neutralization, concentration limits (30% per sector), and compliance requirements
- **Portfolio Construction**: Score aggregation, tilt mapping {1,2,3,4,5} â†’ {-2,-1,0,+1,+2}, and execution workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Complete compliance documentation from LLM reasoning to tradeable positions

## Project Context

This Memory Bank supports the companion repository for "Charting the Future: Harnessing LLMs for Quantitative Finance" by Colin Alexander, CFA, CIPM. The project demonstrates practical applications of Large Language Models in systematic investment management while maintaining institutional-grade risk controls and regulatory compliance.
