- Performance attribution and factor analysis
- Backtesting and historical validation framework

## Known Issues and Challenges

### 🚨 Technical Challenges
**1. Inverse ETF Tracking**
- **Daily Reset Risk**: -2x leveraged funds reset daily, creating path dependency
- **Tracking Error**: Deviation between intended -1x exposure and realized performance
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Some inverse ETFs have wider spreads and shallower books

**2. API Reliability**
- **Rate Limiting**: OpenAI API quotas may constrain real-time analysis
- **Latency Variation**: o3-deep-research can take 60-180 seconds per sector
- **Cost Management**: Ensemble of 11 sectors × 2 models = $20-50 per full analysis

**3. Data Quality**
- **Reference Accessibility**: Some financial URLs require subscriptions
- **Information Currency**: Market data freshness vs. analysis latency
- **Confidence Calibration**: Mapping model uncertainty to position sizing

### 🚨 Operational Challenges
**1. Regulatory Compliance**
- **SR 11-7 Requirements**: Model governance and validation documentation
- **Audit Trail Completeness**: Full reconstruction from inputs to orders
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking vs. regulatory expectations

**2. Portfolio Implementation**
- **Execution Timing**: Optimal rebalance windows for ETF liquidity
- **Transaction Costs**: Modeling bid-ask spreads and market impact
- **Capacity Constraints**: Scalability limits based on ETF average daily volume

## Success Metrics and Validation

### 📊 Information Quality
- **Target Hit Rate**: 60%+ sector calls correct over 4-week horizon
- **Information Coefficient**: 0.05+ correlation between scores and returns
- **Confidence Calibration**: ±10% accuracy between stated and realized confidence

### 📊 Operational Excellence  
- **Latency**: <5 minutes from market data to updated scores

### 🎯 Success Gates (Spec-Driven Validation)
**Phase 1 Gate**: All acceptance criteria met with automated test validation
- 11 sectors analyzed with valid 1-5 scores
- 95%+ reliability across 100 test analyses
- Ensemble agreement within 1 point 80%+ of time
- Complete audit trail for compliance review

**Phase 2 Gate**: Portfolio construction fully operational
- Beta neutralization within ±0.1 for all constructions
- Zero concentration limit violations
- Sub-30 second construction performance
- Risk management constraints properly enforced

The spec-driven approach ensures every deliverable is measurable and testable before implementation, providing clear success criteria and preventing scope creep throughout the development process.
